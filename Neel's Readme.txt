This is my (Neel's) personal copy of iD Software's Enemy Territory (2003?)... I have taken provided source code off of the official Github repo and through reverse engineering, obtained the FULL source code (AKA downloaded the game and then blah blah blah)... Follows all copyright protection notices.... I am NOT responsible for anything to happen... Cheers! 'Appy coding!

Note:
Written in C++
Use Visual Studios 2010-2015 or anything in between... Could use Linux/Mac... Any IDE should work.... Code:Blocks? Would have to get essential Windows Headers and MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studios) Headers and such...
